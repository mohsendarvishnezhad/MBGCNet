How to Execute the Code:

To run the entire pipeline, follow these steps precisely:
First, ensure that all the required Python libraries are installed.

Next, load your PolSAR dataset into the variable PolSAR, the ground truth map into gt, and define the training and testing sample coordinates in centers and all_centers, respectively. You should also define the patch sizes for feature extraction.

After setting up all input data, make sure the entire script — including dataset preparation, the self-supervised model training, feature extraction, feature selection, and the final SVM or RF classification — is placed inside a Python script or notebook. At the end of the script, call the main() function.

The script will automatically execute each step, starting from patch difficulty ranking using deep curriculum learning, through multi-scale feature extraction and feature fusion, to final classification using an ensemble of SVM or RF models. The process concludes by displaying the classified map and reporting classification accuracy metrics.
