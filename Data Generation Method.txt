Data Generation Method

Synthetic PolSAR Data:

Image dimensions are set to 100×100 pixels with 20 bands

Data values are randomly generated between 0 and 1 

This simulates a simple polarimetric image without real-world complex characteristics


Ground Truth Map (GTM):

Has the same dimensions as the main image (100×100)

Contains random integer values between 1 and 5 (representing 5 classes)

Serves as a simulated classification reference for testing purposes



Purpose:
This synthetic data is simple and unrealistic, designed specifically for:

Algorithm verification
Testing basic functionality of classification and processing methods
